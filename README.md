# Parallax Site
A simple landing page that utilizes a parallax effect.

## Description

I created this simple webpage as a template to try out a few CSS techniques that I have been interested in trying to implement. The webpage currently contains placeholder content, and I could see it being used for a blog. This site has a parallax effect on the background to keep the image in a fixed position while scrolling. It also has a sticky navbar, as well as several components from Bulma, a CSS framework.

I really appreciated the opportunity to work with a new CSS framework as I designed this page. Most of the sites I have created have utilized Bootstrap in some way, so I was excited for the opportunity to learn about a new tool. Bulma certainly has some unique features I haven't seen before, and I'm excited to use it in other projects as well. Between using Bulma and custom CSS for this site, I didn't run into many issues and felt that Bulma made designing the UI pretty straightforward.

Overall, creating this site was very helpful for me, and I am confident that I will use what I have learned in other projects as well. I'm proud of how polished this site looks.

A few ideas for future development include:

- Turning the site into a blog with additional pages
- Using React to turn the site into a fully functional SPA
- Continuing to try out and customize Bulma components
